# My Project

This project is a restaurant related website. I have given this website name Flavor Fusion. Here are some of the key features of this website:

* This website has user authentication feature.
* Normally user can visit the Home page but there has a private rout connected with the view recipe button. So if the user wants to visit the view recipe page he/she has to login first.
* Clicking on the view detail button it will redirect the user to login page if he/she is not logged in. If the user is logged in then it will take the user to the view recipe page.
* If the user has no account registered for this website he/she has to create an account or register first then can login.
* If the user don't want to register then he/she can also login with Google and Github without register with email-password.
